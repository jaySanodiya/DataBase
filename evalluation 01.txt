Problem 2: (marks 6)
What is the 3NF? Explain with an example. You donâ€™t need to draw the
tables or write the queries. Just mention the schema before and after the
third normal form.

answer :---   
* 3NF is third normalise form. 

* conditions for database to be in 3NF is 
	1. It should be in 2NF
	2. Any Transitive functional dependency of non prime atribut with super key must be removed.

* Transitive functional dependency :- if X is dependent on Y and Y is dependent on Z then we can say 	that X is indirectly dependent on Z also this is known as transitive functional dependency.
	Example :- if A is cousin of B and B is cousin of C then A and C are also cousins.

* Non prime attribute :- attributes of candidate key, are called prime attributes. And rest of the 	attributes of the relation are non prime. E.g. for the relation {rollno, name, city, phoneNo} 		{rollno}   is a candidate key and hence rollno is a prime attribute and name, city, phoneno are 		non prime attributes.

* condition of a table before 3NF -----

		|  cust_Id  |  cust_name  |  Shipping_Address  |  NewsLetter     |
                |           |             |		       |	         |
		|  jay_sk   |   jay   	  |    seoni	       |   X-box News    |
                |  rohit_dv |   rohit     |    bhopal	       |  play_station   |
		|  roger_ad |   roger     |    mumbai          |   X-box News    |
		|  jay_sk   |   jay   	  |    seoni	       |   play_station  |

             To convert it into 3NF we have to divide this table into two table as follow

		Table 1 with cust_Id as primary key
              
		|  cust_Id  |  cust_name  |  Shipping_Address  |
                |           |             |		       |
		|  jay_sk   |   jay   	  |    seoni	       |
                |  rohit_dv |   rohit     |    bhopal	       |
		|  roger_ad |   roger     |    mumbai          |
		

		Table 2 with cust_Id as primary key

		|  cust_Id  |    NewsLetter   |
                |           |          	      |
		|  jay_sk   |    X-box News   |
                |  rohit_dv |  play_station   |
		|  roger_ad |    X-box News   |
		|  jay_sk   |   play_station  |
